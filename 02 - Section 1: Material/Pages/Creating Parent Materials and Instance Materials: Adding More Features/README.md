# Creating Parent Materials and Instance Materials: Adding More Features

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Using Master Materials and Material Instances in Unreal Engine is crucial for three main reasons: <img style="float: right;" src="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/courses/311/files/19595/preview?verifier=i4jWuRrKgPWvra4nYIJ5P5P2T4N7Rn6gU3BVDD9i" alt="image.png" width="467" height="325" data-api-endpoint="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/311/files/19595" data-api-returntype="File"></span></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1. Consistency and Efficiency:</strong> Master Materials establish a consistent foundation for materials, ensuring visual coherence and reducing the need for redundant material creation. Material Instances allow for efficient customization and variation while maintaining a connection to the original Master Material, saving time and effort in managing material assets.<br><strong>2. Flexibility and Iteration: </strong>Master Materials provide a flexible framework that can be easily modified and extended, allowing for rapid iteration and experimentation with material properties and effects. Material Instances enable artists to customize specific parameters without impacting the entire material, empowering them to achieve unique visual results quickly and efficiently.<br><strong>3. Performance Optimization:</strong> Material Instances inherit the base properties and shaders of the Master Material, reducing memory usage and optimizing rendering performance. By utilizing Material Instances, artists can create a diverse range of materials while ensuring optimal performance in real-time applications, such as games or simulations.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Let's create a couple switch parameters for instances:<img style="float: right;" src="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/courses/311/files/19596/preview?verifier=fYnkXhG7QJUIjBI1S5ISxtOuNGHhgjbxw3AjTeCn" alt="image.png" width="497" height="318" data-api-endpoint="https://vertexschool.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/311/files/19596" data-api-returntype="File"></strong></span></p>
<p>Here will create a switch function for metallic. As we've discussed before metallic is either true or false, but we also need to consider texture. Let's first determine whether we are going to have metallic or non-metallic and then we'll set up another switch to determine if we're going to do a uniform or texture. In the instance we'll be able to determine whether we're using a texture or uniform color if we choose uniform color, we can then decide whether it's going to be white or black (Metallic or not)</p>
<p>Secondly let's create a tiling switch. Were there texture coordinates we can either tile uniformly or choose an individual axis to manipulate. For this we will set up a texture coordinate note connected to a multiply with a single scalar parameter we can do this uniformly both X and Y. But if we use two scale of parameters each indicated to be X or Y we can append those two vectors together and adjust the X and Y values separately. At the end we'll be able to determine if you want to tile uniformly or if we'd like to stretch or squash our texture.</p>
